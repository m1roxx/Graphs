# Graphs
## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of graph algorithms in Java, including Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Dijkstra's Algorithm for weighted graphs. The project includes custom classes to represent vertices, graphs, and search algorithms.

## Project Structure
- **Vertex.java**: Represents a vertex in the graph.
- **WeightedGraph.java**: Represents a weighted graph using an adjacency list.
- **MyGraph.java**: Represents an unweighted graph using an adjacency list.
- **Search.java**: Abstract class for search algorithms.
- **BreadthFirstSearch.java**: Implements BFS algorithm.
- **DepthFirstSearch.java**: Implements DFS algorithm.
- **DijkstraSearch.java**: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm.
- **Main.java**: Demonstrates example usage of the graph and search classes.
